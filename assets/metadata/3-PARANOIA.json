  "description": "The third song in the collection from “We Survived The Storm” The inspiration behind this piece and the music came from the pursuit of taking risks and decisions that people make daily. As we get caught up in work, relationships, and our passions, we must keep pursuing our dreams no matter how far out they may be. In this image, characters are jumping in parachutes through this stormy foreground.",
